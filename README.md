# Arcane and Agatha All Along are my current favorite series.
**Arcane is my favorite because of the characters, music composition, animation, and writing. Season 1 showed that nobody is a villain in their own story. We can see different perspectives in Arcane, which made me like it more.** :boom:

**As for Agatha All Along, it is my favorite since it continues the story of WandaVision, a series that I also loved.**
*Episode 7 was my favorite.* :purple_heart:
## Both of my favorite series also have high ratings on IMDb.
